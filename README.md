- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Final-star
- 
- I am currently interested in the Chinese foreign study market. When Chinese students go to other countries, they usually can't adapt to the local market very quickly.
-     When they just arrive in the local country, they prefer to use their familiar procedures in terms of life when dealing with the heavy moving/staying in/transportation,
-     and there is usually a large, settled Chinese community that has the potential to provide the relevant services,
-     so I would like to build a Chinese-to-Chinese living I would like to build a Chinese-to-Chinese living app to provide services such as moving/house maintenance/furniture/transportation.

- I can provide a source of international students in several major universities in mainland China,
-    provide the personnel or other corporate support needed between mainland China and the United States, and provide the funding needed for the process.
     I expect you to have a sound adult personality and can provide mature and sound technical support related to the programme.
